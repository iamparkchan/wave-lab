# Wave Lab
Wave propagation simulation demo for educational purpose

* main.c : C source code for parallel version of wave lab. A MPI implementation is necessary to compile and run.
* main_serial.c : C source code for serial version of wave lab.
* plot.py : Python source code to show animation. It read "parameters.txt" and "output".

# Numerical Method
The following methods are implemented in Wave Lab.

* 2nd order finite difference method
* 2 step of iterative Crank-Nicolson method
